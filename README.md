Personal Portfolio

My site is hosted here: jasonmcgrath.netlify.app

My portfolio is built with HTML(30%) CSS (43%) and JavaScript (27%).  
  

UI/UX DESIGN:
I wanted to have some unifying theme so I went with a water theme (Splash page water drop, rain drops for background video, darker blue color pallette)

SPLASH PAGE:
splash page for entry to homepage built with JS for the entry process.

NAV BAR
I opted to build a side nav bar vs the traditional top nav bar. 
The hav bar has a highlighted hover bar as you move through the listed items.

Upon resume click I have my resume appear modal style and cover the viewport.  
The entry and close to access the resume are built with JavaScript.

I have a sub-menu for projects that links to 3 seperate project pages (see below)

The "About Me", "Technical Skills", and "Links & Contacts" sections will all auto-scroll upon click from the Nav Bar (HTML a tag linking).

CONTENT:
In the "About Me" section I tried to highlight some philosophical tenets/soft skills of mine in the "Who am I?" part and in the "How did I get here" brief I attempted to allude to the journey that brought me to software engineering and what I enjoy about it.

For the "Technical Skills" I only noted the three core technologies that we have been focusing on so far in the immersive.  I will add to that as I become proficient in other techs.

Contacts has linked HTML's which will pop open my LinkedIn and GitHubs pages in new windows.  Upon clicking "Email/Phone", a hidden Div will appear (JavaScript) with that information.

PROJECTS:
I have 3 projects that will appear in new windows upong clicking them in the Projects sub-menu.

Countdown Clock: I built an application that will tell you how many days are left to a target date.  This application is built out of Javascript.

Word Snake: Is a word game that will only accept words that start with the last letter of the previous word.  That app is also built out in JavaScript.

Rock, Paper, Scissors:  An application in which you pick Rock, Paper, or Scissors and the Computer will auto-generate their pick and upon submission the result will auto-populate.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN: 
The portfolio and projects should all be sufficiently viewable on mobile, tablet, desktop
